# **Instagram Reels Virality Prediction using Apify**


This repository contains the code for predicting the virality of Instagram Reels, using data extracted by Apify. The aim of this project is to help content creators understand the factors that affect the success of their Reels and to provide recommendations for improving the virality of their content.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow the instructions below.

## Prerequisites

To run this project, you will need the following software:

Python 3.7 or later
Jupyter Notebook
NumPy
Pandas
Scikit-learn
Matplotlib
Seaborn
flask
## Installing

## Usage


To use this project, follow the steps below.

Clone this repository to your local machine.
Open app.py  in Vs code.
Use the trained model to predict the virality of new Instagram Reels.


## Dataset


The dataset used in this project was collected by scraping Instagram Reels using Apify. It contains information about the number of views, likes, comments, and shares for a set of Reels, as well as various metadata such as the date and time the Reel was posted, the hashtags used, and the user who posted the Reel.

## Model


The model used in this project is a linear regression model. It takes as input various features of the Reel, such as the number of views, likes, comments, and shares, as well as metadata such as the date and time the Reel was posted and the hashtags used, and outputs a prediction of the number of views the Reel is likely to receive.

## Results


The results of this project show that the number of views, likes, comments, and shares are the most important factors in predicting the virality of an Instagram Reel. Other factors, such as the date and time the Reel was posted and the hashtags used, also have a significant impact on the virality of the Reel.
